# Neural_Graph_Collaborative_Filtering
Reproducing Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering
1. Open Google Colab(https://colab.research.google.com/), open the file "Neural_Graph_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb"
2. Copy and Paste the whole folder "/NGCF_data/" to your Google Drive
3. Run "Neural_Graph_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb"


I used paperswithcode.com, and referred to the following reproducing code:
